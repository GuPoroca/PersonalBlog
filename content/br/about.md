Here is the end :(

I'm (almost) a graduated computer engineer at UPE, my hobbies are pretty much all related to computers and electronics. I currently work as a QA engineer at CESAR and I love penguins and cats.

My plan here is to documment my projects and post my thoughts on computer related stuff, ranging all from simple electronics to webdevelopment.
## I am far from an expert in any field, so by reading this I expect you to know that you are following a journey on learning and discovery.


So, there you have it... enjoy!

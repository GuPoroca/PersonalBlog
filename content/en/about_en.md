# Hello everyone,  

My name is Gustavo Poroca, I’m (almost) graduating in Computer Engineering at UPE and I’m building this blog in my free time to document a bit of my day-to-day activities!  

## A little about me:  
My hobbies are very connected to computing, it’s an activity I genuinely enjoy. Besides that, I love puzzles (specifically the Rubik’s cube) and volleyball, even though I haven’t played much lately. Currently, I work as a QA Engineer at CESAR. I also love cats and penguins.  

As I mentioned earlier, my plans here are to document my thoughts and activities. If you’re interested, feel free to reach out to me so we can work on a project together or just chat and discuss the topics I bring up here.  

### Disclaimer: I don’t consider myself an expert in any field, so expect to find more of a journey of discovery and learning around here.

Ah, you might be wondering about the names of the Greek figures in the blog header. I’m also fascinated by mythology, and I wanted to bring a bit of that here. For now, the site will be organized into 4 tags:  

- **Apollo**: God of the sun and the fine arts. Here I’ll post all my more artistic activities, which unfortunately are not my strongest side.  
- **Athena**: Goddess of wisdom and reason. Here I’ll post some of my personal opinions on certain topics. In the posts without this tag, I’ll try to keep things as objective as I can.  
- **Daedalus**: A talented Architect and Inventor. The only one who is mortal — and ironically my specialty. Daedalus will be the tag for everything related to software in my blog: projects and other stuff.  
- **Hephaestus**: God of the forge and artisans. Here I’ll post all my experiences tinkering with Hardware, which I also enjoy a lot, but treat much more as a hobby than anything close to professional.  

And I believe that’s all for this post. Feel free to reach out!
